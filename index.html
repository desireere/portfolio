<p>
                    <strong>Bruce Jun Fan Lee (Lee Siu Loong)</strong> was born in 1940 in San Francisco, 
                    CA while his parents were on tour with the Chinese Opera. Ultimately 
                    raised in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee was a child actor appearing in more than 20 films. 
                    At the age of 13, Bruce took up the study of wing chun gung fu under renowned wing 
                    chun master, Yip Man.
                    <br><br>
                    Bruce left Hong Kong at the age of 18, came to the United States and made his way 
                    to Seattle, Washington where he worked in the restaurant of a family friend. 
                    He soon enrolled in the University of Washington where he pursued a degree in philosophy. 
                    Bruce began to teach gung fu in Seattle and soon opened his first school, the Jun Fan Gung 
                    Fu Institute. Two more schools followed in Oakland and Los Angeles. Concurrently Bruce 
                    married his wife, Linda and had his two children, Brandon and Shannon. In the mid sixties, 
                    Bruce was discovered while doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals and a role 
                    as Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet soon followed. During this time, Bruce was 
                    also developing his own martial art, 
                    which he ultimately named Jeet Kune Do (translated: the way of the intercepting fist).
                    <br><br>
                    Bruce's art was steeped in a philosophical foundation and did not follow long held martial 
                    traditions. Instead it had at its core the ideas of simplicity, directness and personal 
                    freedom. After The Green Hornet series was canceled, Bruce encountered resistance while 
                    working in Hollywood and so headed to Hong Kong to pursue a film career. In Hong Kong he 
                    made 3 films, which consecutively broke all box office records and showcased martial arts 
                    in an entirely new way. Hollywood took notice and soon Bruce was making the first Hollywood 
                    / Hong Kong coproduction with a film called Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately, Bruce Lee died 
                    in 1973 before this film was released. This film catapulted him to international fame. 
                    Today Bruce Lee’s legacy of self expression, equality, and pioneering innovation continues 
                    to inspire people all around the world.
